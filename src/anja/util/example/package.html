<p>The package provides the classes and interfaces to create examples for the applets
or applications. It includes basic interfaces for each example, 
a manager to handle all examples and listener
and events which simplify the interaction with the user of the applet.<br />
As many applets handle their own examples in the most different ways, this is
a way to standardize this procedure. The polygon editors offer a functionality
to write <code>Polygon2Scenes</code> to an <code>OutputStream</code>. This
option is rather restricted and only offers to save those special scenes.<br />
This package does not only depend on polygonal scenes but can be used to save
very application specific examples (e.g. the polygons and some additional
points as in <code>PolyRobot</code> and a hint on the specific method that should 
be used with this certain example and so on).<br />
It depends on the application which information should be saved and which is
unneccessary to save. Receiving an <code>Example</code> and restoring it
is possible via the listener inferaces in this package.</p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This is the main interface of the package. Every example must implement this
interface. It has two main functionalities. On the one hand there is a <code>name</code>
given for each example. It is e.g. used by the GUI to represent each example and should
therefore be representative for the example itself. On the other hand the serialization
offers the possibility to save whole examples via <code>OutputStream</code>.</p>

<h3>ExampleListener</h3>
<p>The interface should be implemented by all classes that want to be informed if
an example changes - if the user has chosen another example - or should be saved. 
The class then has to register to an eg <code>ExamplePanel</code> before.
</p>


<h2>Classes</h2>

<h3>Adapters</h3>
<p>Some adapters which allow to port serializable objects to <code>byte</code> arrays,
return the Java code to create whole objects and the possibility to port <code>byte</code>
arrays to instances of objects again.</p>

<h3>BasicExample</h3>
<p>This class is a simple implementation of the <code>Example</code> interface.</p>

<h3>ExampleChangeEvent</h3>
<p>The event is send to all <code>ExampleListener</code> objects that have been registered. 
It adds the possibility to additionally add an <code>Example</code> object
to a basic event. The example can be received via <code>getExample()</code> method.</p>


<h3>ExampleManager</h3>
<p>A manager based on an <code>ArrayList</code> that overrides some methods to
work with <code>Example</code> objects.</p>

<h3>ExamplePanel</h3>
<p>The main graphical class of the package. It adds a load and save option for
<code>Example</code> implementing objects. Additionally <code>ExampleListeners</code>
can register and are informed about changes or save requests. To save an example to
file use the method <code>saveExample()</code>. The class handles its own <code>ExampleManager</code>.
To receive a reference use the <code>getExampleManager()</code> method. This way new
examples can be added via the application.<br />
The debug mode prints possible exceptions to the console if enabled. The java code mode displays
a button if enabled, which allows to display the java code of the current example shown in
the combo box. By default the debug mode is enabled and the jc mode is disabled.
</p>

<h3>ExampleSaveEvent</h3>
<p>The event is send to all <code>ExampleListener</code> objects that have been registered. 
It adds the possibility to additionally add a <code>File</code> object
to a basic event. The file can be received via <code>getFile()</code> method.</p>


<h3>An example:</h3>
<p>The main class of the applet should inherit the listener interface and create an instance of
the panel</p>

<pre><code>
public class MyApplet
        extends JApplet
        implements ExampleListener
{
    ...
    private ExamplePanel&lt;MyAppletExample&gt; _examplePanel = new ExamplePanel&lt;MyAppletExample&gt;();
    ...
    
    this.add(_examplePanel);
    _examplePanel.addExampleListener(this);
    ...
    
    ExampleManager&lt;MyAppletExample&gt; em = this._examplePanel.getExampleManager();
    //add some own examples  
    ...
    
    public void exampleChanged(
            ExampleChangeEvent&lt;MyAppletExample&gt; e)
    {
        MyAppletExample ex = e.getExample();
        //do something with the example, e.g. load into Polygoneditor
        //if the whole polygonscene is saved, use the clone() method,
        //otherwise the example in memory is changed if the scene changes      
    }

    public void exampleSave(
            ExampleSaveEvent e)
    {
        MyAppletExample ex = new MyAppletExample();
        //Fill the current scene into the example object
        // ex.p1 = ...;
        // ex.p2 = ...;
        // ex.message = ...;
        // ex.seglist = ...;
        ...
        //The save method can only be called when the example object is ready
        //The load procedure is handled by the panel itself
        _examplePanel.saveExample(e.getFile(), ex);      
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The example object could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>
public class MyAppletExample
        extends BasicExample
        //implements Example
{
    public Polygon2 p1 = null;
    public Polygon2 p2 = null;
    public String message = null;
    public List&lt;Segment2&gt; seglist = null;
    
    public MyAppletExample()
    {
        //name is inherited from BasicExample
        this.name = (new java.util.Date()).toString();
    }

    public MyAppletExample(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
</code></pre>
